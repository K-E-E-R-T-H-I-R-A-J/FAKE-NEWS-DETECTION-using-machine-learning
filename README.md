# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-using-machine-learning

# ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
Fake news classification refers to the process of automatically detecting and identifying news articles or misleading information. This is typically done using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyse the content of the article and identify patterns that indicate it is likely to be fake or misleading.

# ðŸš€ Objectives of the project
â€¢	Identifying and flagging fake news articles
â€¢	Promoting informed decision-making
â€¢	Mitigating the impact of fake news
â€¢	Advancing research

# ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
The project successfully developed a system for fake news classification using NLP techniques and evaluated its performance using various metrics. The results highlight the potential of NLP techniques in detecting fake news, and the system can be further optimized and expanded to improve its accuracy and scalability.
